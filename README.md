# automationnexus/.github

Org-wide GitHub Actions reusable workflows, repo templates, and shared config for AutomationNexus.

## Reusable workflows (`.github/workflows/`, pin `@v1`)

| Workflow | Purpose | Key inputs / secrets |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| `ci.yml` | Unified CI: guards + hygiene + lint + test + optional frontend/e2e/integration/security/ha/addon | `branch-model`, `auto-revert`, `runner-labels`, `has-*`, `lint-paths`, `security-paths`, `pip-install-cmd`, `test-cmd`, `pre/post-test-cmd`, e2e-* · secrets: `ci-bot-app-id`, `ci-bot-app-private-key` |
| `auto-merge.yml` | Waits for PR checks, then merges via CI-Bot App | `main-only` (bool, default `false`; repo has no `dev` branch, so `feature→main` PRs are squash-merged the same way `feature→dev` PRs are) · secrets: `ci-bot-app-id`, `ci-bot-app-private-key` |
| `promote-dev-to-main.yml` | Verifies dev CI, opens dev→main PR, waits for its CI, merges | `runner-labels`, `exclude-paths` (main-owned paths restored after a throwaway branch based on current main merges dev), `strip-dev-only-paths` (bool; deletes files matching `.github/dev-only-paths` from the promote branch, e.g. `CLAUDE.md`/`.claude/`), `bump-type` (`patch`/`minor`/`major`/`none`, default `patch`; bumps `pyproject.toml`'s version off the latest `vX.Y.Z` tag reachable on main, folded into the promote branch) · CI-Bot secrets |
| `nightly.yml` | Nightly Docker build from dev | `image-name`, `platforms`, `force_run`, `has-frontend`, `coverage-threshold`, `pip-install-cmd`, `test-cmd` |
| `release-docker.yml` | Tag (from pyproject) → build/push GHCR → Release → Trivy | `image-name`, `platforms`, `tag_name`, `has-frontend`, `has-validation` |
| `release-pypi.yml` | Tag (from pyproject) → build wheel → PyPI upload (token) → Release | `has-frontend`, `tag_name` · secret: `pypi-api-token` |
| `semgrep.yml` | SAST scan | none |
| `docs.yml` | MkDocs Material → GitHub Pages | none |

Tags: `@v1` (stable) and `@latest` track the current release. Pin to a SHA for stricter security.

## Authentication model

- **CI-Bot GitHub App** (`AutomationNexus CI Bot`, app id `4168350`) performs all merges/promotions/
  cross-repo syncs. App-token pushes cascade to downstream workflows (unlike `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
  Every consumer repo stores `CI_BOT_APP_ID` + `CI_BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` as repo secrets and the App
  must be installed on the repo.
- **No PATs.** The old `REPO_DISPATCH_PAT` is fully removed.
- **PyPI**: token-based (`PYPI_API_TOKEN`) because PyPI OIDC trusted publishing rejects reusable
  workflows. Docker/GHCR uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Branch protection

- **Public repos**: rulesets `protect-dev` / `protect-main` with the CI-Bot App as bypass actor — see
  `.github/rulesets/`.
- **Private repos** (GitHub Free can't use rulesets): CI guards + `auto-revert: true` in `ci.yml`.

## CI/CD flow

```
feature → PR to dev → ci.yml (guards/lint/test/…) + semgrep → auto-merge (CI-Bot, after green) → dev
dev → nightly.yml (build :nightly)
promote-dev-to-main (CI-Bot): dev CI green → dev→main PR → its CI green → merge
main push → release-{docker|pypi}.yml → tag (from pyproject) → publish → GitHub Release
```

### Promotion reconciliation

When `exclude-paths`, `strip-dev-only-paths`, or a version bump requires a temporary
promotion branch, it starts at the current `main` snapshot and merges `dev` into it.
Ordinary overlapping content follows `dev`; `exclude-paths` are then restored from
`main`, dev-only paths are removed, and the workflow-owned version bump is applied.
The branch is rebuilt from fresh refs if `main` moves while it is being promoted.
Run the isolated regression suite with:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_promote_reconcile.py
```

## New repos

- **Full guide**: [`docs/new-repo-guide.md`](docs/new-repo-guide.md) — click-to-create + the
  `scripts/bootstrap-repo.sh` one-shot that wires branches, default branch, secrets, and protection.
- **Starter bundles**: `.github/templates/<group>/` — copy the whole `.github/` for the matching group:
  - `A-python-docker`, `B-python-pypi`, `C-docker-ha-addon`, `D-infra-main-only`, `E-ha-config`
  - See `.github/templates/README.md` for the group table and per-group setup.
  - **After editing any starter bundle, run `scripts/sync-templates.sh`** — it does not auto-sync to the `AutomationNexus/template-*` repos.

## AI tooling

The org uses **Claude Code**. Convention: `CLAUDE.md` and
`.claude/agents|commands|settings.json` are **committed on `dev`**, stripped from `main`
by `.github/dev-only-paths`; only `CLAUDE.local.md` and `.claude/settings.local.json` are
gitignored (personal, never shared). No model/provider/router config lives in any repo —
Claude Code talks directly to Anthropic with the operator's own account.

See [`docs/ai-migration.md`](docs/ai-migration.md) for the full decision record, model-tier
mapping, and per-repo rollout status.

### Governance

The AI agent organization (org-tier + per-repo teams), the human GitHub teams that
actually hold permissions, repository ownership, and every documented exception are
tracked in [`governance/registry.yml`](governance/registry.yml) — the single source of
truth. Read [`governance/README.md`](governance/README.md) first for terminology and
the human-vs-AI distinction (AI agents hold no GitHub permissions or team membership;
only `human_teams` do), then [`governance/organogram.md`](governance/organogram.md) for
the rendered hierarchy and repo/team/task matrix. Validate the registry and every
agent/command file against it with:

```bash
python scripts/validate-governance.py [--live]
```

`--live` additionally cross-checks the registry against real GitHub state (default
branches, teams, rulesets); failures there are reported as `permission-limited`, not
errors, when the query itself is unauthorized rather than the state being wrong.

Scenario fixtures assert routing, required agents, confirmation points, and expected
artifacts for 9 realistic task shapes (trivial fix, multi-domain feature, shared-workflow
rollout, security-sensitive change, promote, template sync, collision, permission-limited
query, ARCRunner minimal task) against the real registry — read-only, no dispatch:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_governance_scenarios.py
```
